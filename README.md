# Challege 20: React Portfolio.


This react.js portfolio app wasn't easy but I am seeing progress in being able to pull different ideas together to come up with a more cohesive understanding of what I am doing how to do it efficiently and effectively. I plan to continue to improve on this going forward the graphics and stlye could be given a good bit more time for some subtle adjustments that can really help the page standout. 

## Lessons Learned

1. Initially learning to use react it seemed a bit daunting but so far it seems to be efficient and relatively user friendly.

2. the HMR through react-scripts is very nice, not sure if is also responsible for the feedback being provided in the terminal but between the two
they certainly help improve time usage.


## Notation and references
A wide variety of tutorials were used to help here. I do not believe any code was directly pasted into my file as such I don't have any direct citations listed.

Files across Model 20 was used for as a good bit of starter code. I don't believe any code was simply pasted 100% without some modification.
